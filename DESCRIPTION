Description: Provides a generic, publisher-independent Rmarkdown template for writing 
  scientific papers and reports in Rmarkdown. The template allows for all the basic features of a
  scientific article, including a title page with author affiliations and footnotes possibly shown
  in two common formats, multi-language abstracts and keywords, page headers and footers, and 
  the ability to place figures and tables at the end of the output PDF. Smart cross-referencing of
  figures, tables, equations and sections is provided using the bookdown package. See package
  README.md for basic package usage.
